# Node.js App

This is a simple Node.js application that can be run locally using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Kubernetes

## Getting Started

To run the Node.js app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/copilot-jenkins-k8s/copilot-jenkins-k8s.git
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t node-app .
   ```

3. Deploy the application to Kubernetes:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
   ```

4. Access the application:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/node-app 8080:80
   ```

   The Node.js app will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
